Each day, to enter their building, employees of an e-commerce company have to type a string of numbers into a console using a `3 Ã— 3` numeric keypad.

Every day, the numbers on the keypad are mixed up. Use the following rules to calculate the total amount of time it takes to type a string:

- It takes `O` seconds to move their finger to the first key, and it takes `O` seconds to press the key where their finger is located any number of times.
- They can move their finger from one location to any adjacent key in one second. Adjacent keys include those on a diagonal.
- Moving to a non-adjacent key is done as a series of moves to adjacent keys.
