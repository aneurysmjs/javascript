## Queue

A queue is a collection of items that obeys the principle of first-in/first-out(FIFO).
When we place an item into the queue, we can only get it out after all the other  
items that have been added before it have been removed.

## Stack

A stack is a collection of items that obeys the principle of last in, first out (LIFO).  
When we place a new item onto the stack, we have to remove it first before we get  
to any other item in the stack that's there before.

## binary search

A BST is a tree-like data structure where each node has 0 - 2 child nodes

BST's can be divided in 3 types:

### Full binary tree

is where each node has 0 or 2 child nodes

```
     o
    / \
   o   o
      / \
     o   o
    / \
   o   o
```

### Complete binary tree

every level. except the last one is completely filled
is always filled from top to bottom - left to right

```
        o
      /   \
     o     o
    / \   / \
   o   o o   o
  / \
 o   o
```

### Perfect binary tree

is both full and complete

```
        o
      /   \
     o     o
    / \   / \
   o   o o   o
```
