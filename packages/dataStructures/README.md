## Queue

A queue is a collection of items that obeys the principle of first-in/first-out(FIFO). 
When we place an item into the queue, we can only get it out after all the other   
items that have been added before it have been removed.

## Stack

A stack is a collection of items that obeys the principle of last in, first out (LIFO).  
When we place a new item onto the stack, we have to remove it first before we get  
to any other item in the stack that's there before.
